        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>PuppR was inspired by our love for dogs and our desire to help dog owners find compatible playmates for their furry friends. As dog owners ourselves, we know how important it is for dogs to have social interactions and playtime with other dogs, and we wanted to make it easier for owners to find suitable playmates for their pets.</p>
        <p>We are a team of passionate developers who are committed to making PuppR the go-to platform for dog owners looking to connect with other dog owners in their area. This project is part of our portfolio for Holberton School, where we are honing our skills in software development.</p>
